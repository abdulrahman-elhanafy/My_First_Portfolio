# Portfolio

> 🧠 This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Engineering Program** — built to demonstrate core HTML skills like structure, navigation, embedding, and semantic layout.

This repo contains basic HTML projects that showcase my understanding of HTML5 without using any CSS or frameworks. It includes simple web pages, internal linking, media embedding, and a personal portfolio page.
